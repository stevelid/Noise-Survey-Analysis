- Display resolution: 1920x1080 or higher recommended

Installation:

1. Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed on your system
   - Check version: python --version

2. Install VLC Media Player from https://www.videolan.org/vlc/
   - This is required for synchronized audio playback

3. Clone or download the Noise Survey Analysis repository

4. Open a terminal/command prompt in the application directory

5. Install required Python packages:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

6. Verify installation by running:
   bokeh serve noise_survey_analysis --show

First-Time Setup:

1. Organize your data files in a logical directory structure:
   - Keep log files, audio files, and related data together
   - Use consistent naming conventions for measurement positions

2. Launch the application using one of the methods in Section 3

3. Use the Data Source Selector to choose your files:
   - Drag and drop files or folders onto the window
   - Or use the "Scan Job Directory" feature for organized projects

4. Assign position names (e.g., "North", "East", "West")

5. Save your configuration as a .json file for future use

6. The dashboard will load with your data ready for analysis

================================================================================
3. CREATING A DASHBOARD
================================================================================

Preparing Your Data:

The application supports multiple file formats from common sound level meters:

- NTi Audio: .txt log files with spectral data
- Svan: .csv and .xlsx files (both log and summary formats)
- Noise Sentry: .csv files with resampled data
- Audio: .wav files (other formats supported with soundfile library)

Data Preparation Tips:
- Keep all files for a measurement position in the same directory
- Ensure audio files have timestamps in their filenames or metadata
- Use consistent date/time formats across all data sources
- Remove any corrupted or incomplete files before loading

Creating a Configuration File:

Configuration files (.json) define which data files to load and how to
organize them. They can be created in two ways:

Method 1: Using the Data Source Selector (Recommended)
1. Run: bokeh serve noise_survey_analysis --show
2. Use the interactive selector to choose files
3. Click "Save Config" to generate a .json file
4. The file is portable - move it with your data

Method 2: Manual Creation
Create a JSON file with this structure:

{
  "version": "1.2",
  "created_at": "2025-10-01T10:00:00.000000",
  "config_base_path": "C:/Projects/NoiseData/Job1234",
  "sources": [
    {
      "path": "Position1/log_data.csv",
      "position": "North",
      "type": "svan_log",
      "parser_type": "svan"
    },
    {
      "path": "Position1/Audio/",
      "position": "North",
      "type": "audio_dir",
      "parser_type": "audio"
    }
  ]
}

Key fields:
- config_base_path: Root directory for all relative paths
- path: File or directory path relative to config_base_path
- position: Display name for the measurement location
- parser_type: svan, nti, sentry, or audio

Running the Application:

There are three ways to run the application:

A) Interactive Server Mode (Full Features)
   bokeh serve noise_survey_analysis --show
   
   - Opens the Data Source Selector
   - Full audio playback support
   - Real-time interaction with Python backend
   - Best for active analysis work

B) Server Mode with Configuration
   bokeh serve noise_survey_analysis --show --args --config path/to/config.json
   
   - Loads data directly from saved configuration
   - Bypasses the file selector
   - Ideal for returning to previous work
   - Can also load saved workspace state:
     --args --config config.json --state workspace.json

C) Static HTML Generation (For Sharing)
   python -m noise_survey_analysis.main --generate-static path/to/config.json
   
   - Creates a single .html file
   - No Python server required to view
   - Audio playback disabled
   - Perfect for reports and email distribution
   - Output file saved in same directory as config

Opening the Generated Dashboard:

- Positive values: Shift chart data forward in time
- Negative values: Shift chart data backward in time
- Range: Typically ±300 seconds
- Use when:
  - Sound level meter clock was incorrect
  - Data needs alignment with audio
  - Compensating for known time errors
- Effective offset display shows combined offset

Audio Time Offset:
- Use spinner to adjust audio timing
- Positive values: Audio plays later (delayed)
- Negative values: Audio plays earlier (advanced)
- Range: Typically ±300 seconds
- Use when:
  - Audio recorder clock was incorrect
  - Audio needs alignment with chart data
  - Fine-tuning synchronization
- Effective offset display shows combined offset

Effective Offset Display:
- Shows net time offset between chart and audio
- Calculation: Chart Offset - Audio Offset
- Example: Chart +5s, Audio -3s = Effective +8s
- Updates automatically when either spinner changes
- Helps understand total synchronization adjustment

Synchronized Playback:

How Synchronization Works:
- Audio playback is synchronized with chart timeline
- When you click on a chart, audio seeks to that timestamp
- Tap line shows current playback position
- Audio advances in real-time with chart data
- All positions maintain independent playback states

Using Synchronized Playback:

1. Basic Playback:
   - Click on chart to set starting position
   - Press Spacebar or click Play toggle
   - Audio plays from that timestamp
   - Tap line remains at playback position

2. Seeking During Playback:
   - Click anywhere on chart while audio is playing
   - Audio immediately seeks to new position
   - Playback continues from new location
   - No need to pause first

3. Reviewing Specific Events:
   - Create marker at event of interest
   - Click marker to jump to that timestamp
   - Press Spacebar to play audio from marker
   - Use arrow keys to step through data points

4. Comparing Multiple Positions:
   - Start playback on first position
   - Start playback on second position
   - Both play simultaneously from same timestamp
   - Compare noise sources across locations
   - Adjust volume boost independently if needed

5. Fine-Tuning Synchronization:
   - Play audio and watch chart data
   - If audio seems early/late, adjust offsets
   - Use Audio Offset spinner for small adjustments
   - Test synchronization at multiple points
   - Save workspace to preserve offset settings

Troubleshooting Audio:
- If audio doesn't play, verify VLC is installed
- Check that audio files are in correct directories
- Ensure audio filenames contain valid timestamps
- Try adjusting time offsets if sync is off
- Check browser console for error messages
- Audio only works in Server Mode, not Static HTML

9. Use shorter time ranges:
   - Focus on specific periods
   - Create multiple configs for different date ranges
10. Upgrade browser to latest version
11. Increase system RAM if possible
12. Close other applications to free memory

Issue: Regions or markers don't appear

Symptoms:
- Created regions/markers are invisible
- Regions/markers appear in panel but not on charts
- Annotations disappear after creation

Solutions:
1. Check visibility toggles:
   - Ensure "Regions" toggle is enabled
   - Ensure "Markers" toggle is enabled
2. Verify region/marker is within visible time range:
   - Use range selector to zoom out
   - Check timestamps in panel
3. Check region/marker color:
   - Might blend with background
   - Try changing color to high contrast
4. Verify region has valid time span:
   - Start time must be before end time
   - Check for zero-duration regions
5. Check browser console for errors
6. Try refreshing the page (may lose unsaved work)
7. Verify position matches visible charts:
   - Region for "North" won't show on "East" chart
   - Check position assignment in panel
8. Check chart visibility:
   - Chart must be visible to show annotations
   - Enable chart visibility checkbox
9. Try creating new region/marker to test
10. Export and reimport annotations to reset state

Issue: Workspace or annotations won't load

Symptoms:
- Import fails with error message
- Workspace loads but data is missing
- Annotations don't match current data

Solutions:
1. Verify file format:
   - Workspace files are JSON
   - Annotation files are CSV
   - Check file extension
2. Check for file corruption:
   - Open in text editor
   - Verify valid JSON/CSV format
3. Ensure timestamps match current data:
   - Annotations reference specific timestamps
   - Data must cover those time ranges
4. Verify source files match workspace:
   - Workspace references specific config
   - Load matching config first
5. Check for version compatibility:
   - Older workspace files may not be compatible
   - Try exporting annotations instead
6. Look for special characters in notes:
   - May cause parsing issues
   - Edit file to remove problematic characters
7. Try importing on fresh session:
   - Reload page first
   - Then import annotations
8. Check browser console for specific errors
9. Verify file permissions (read access)
10. Try exporting and reimporting to validate format

Issue: Static HTML export is too large

Symptoms:
- Generated HTML file is hundreds of MB
- File is slow to open in browser
